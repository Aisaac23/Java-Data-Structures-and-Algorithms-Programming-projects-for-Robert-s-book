# Data Structures and Algorithms with Java - Programming projects for Robert's book

Java Data Structures and Algorithms Programming projects from Robert Lafore's Book (2nd Edition). These are my proposed solutions to Robert's book (ISBN-13: 978-0672324536). Published here with the intention to offer a point of comparison if you are studying from this book too, so people who want copy-paste their homework keep your lazy hands off of this repository.
